Right now, a staggering 82% of the Web runs on PHP.  At the same time, the use of content management systems and pre-built application frameworks has skyrocketed as well.  For example, 22% of all websites in the world are built on WordPress.  Other frameworks \u2013 such as Joomla!, Drupal, and Magento \u2013 trail not far behind.  More often, while PHP is the actual programming language powering websites, it isn\u2019t \u2018raw\u2019 PHP doing it, but one of these frameworks instead.\n\nThis has led to the growth of very large, but disparate communities.  Each of these separate application systems has their own community that has evolved around them, completely separate from the large PHP community that already existed.  More and more, people are using PHP, but the community is fragmenting.\n\nLast year the team behind php[architect] magazine wanted to create a conference designed to bring these separate communities together and reunite them. Hence, the idea of php[world] was born.  A conference that is designed to bring the entire world of PHP together in one place, to encourage cross-pollination of ideas and sharing of ideals.  We want to have a conference that has tracks designed to appeal to Drupal, WordPress, Joomla, and Magento developers, as much as the Zend Framework, Symfony, CakePHP, and Laravel communities, as well as to PHP developers everywhere.\n\nThe result was a success as many different communities came together, worked, shared information, held an impromptu PHP-FIG meeting and more.  This year we plan on repeating it and making this the biggest PHP conference in terms of both scope and attendees!","stub":"phpworld2015","href":"https:\/\/world.phparch.com\/","icon":"logo-joind.png","latitude":38.93104225,"longitude":-77.245852888519,"tz_continent":"America","tz_place":"New_York","location":"Sheraton Premiere","contact_name":0,"hashtag":"#phpworld","attendee_count":0,"attending":false,"event_average_rating":0,"comments_enabled":0,"event_comments_count":0,"tracks_count":0,"talks_count":0,"cfp_start_date":"2015-05-05T20:00:00-04:00","cfp_end_date":"2015-06-05T20:00:00-04:00","cfp_url":"https:\/\/world.phparch.com\/call-for-papers\/","talk_comments_count":0,"tags":["php","phpdotnet","laravel","wordpress","drupal"],"uri":"http:\/\/api.joind.in\/v2.1\/events\/3944","verbose_uri":"http:\/\/api.joind.in\/v2.1\/events\/3944?verbose=yes","comments_uri":"http:\/\/api.joind.in\/v2.1\/events\/3944\/comments","talks_uri":"http:\/\/api.joind.in\/v2.1\/events\/3944\/talks","tracks_uri":"http:\/\/api.joind.in\/v2.1\/events\/3944\/tracks","attending_uri":"http:\/\/api.joind.in\/v2.1\/events\/3944\/attending","website_uri":"http:\/\/joind.in\/event\/view\/3944","humane_website_uri":"http:\/\/joind.in\/event\/phpworld2015","all_talk_comments_uri":"http:\/\/api.joind.in\/v2.1\/events\/3944\/talk_comments","hosts":[{"host_name":"Eli White","host_uri":"http:\/\/api.joind.in\/v2.1\/users\/225"}],"attendees_uri":"http:\/\/api.joind.in\/v2.1\/events\/3944\/attendees","can_edit":false},{"name":"Forum PHP 2015","url_friendly_name":"forum-php-2015","start_date":"2015-11-23T00:00:00+01:00","end_date":"2015-11-24T23:59:59+01:00","description":"The annual conference organized by the French PHP-users group, gathering all PHP and Open Source communities, pros and PHP lovers.","stub":null,"href":null,"icon":null,"latitude":48.8189261,"longitude":2.3194466982528,"tz_continent":"Europe","tz_place":"Amsterdam","location":"Beffroi de Montrouge","contact_name":"AFUP","hashtag":null,"attendee_count":0,"attending":false,"event_average_rating":0,"comments_enabled":0,"event_comments_count":0,"tracks_count":0,"talks_count":0,"cfp_start_date":"2015-05-20T00:00:00+02:00","cfp_end_date":"2015-08-15T23:59:59+02:00","cfp_url":"http:\/\/www.afup.org\/pages\/forumphp2015\/appel-a-conferenciers.php","talk_comments_count":0,"tags":[],"uri":"http:\/\/api.joind.in\/v2.1\/events\/3950","verbose_uri":"http:\/\/api.joind.in\/v2.1\/events\/3950?verbose=yes","comments_uri":"http:\/\/api.joind.in\/v2.1\/events\/3950\/comments","talks_uri":"http:\/\/api.joind.in\/v2.1\/events\/3950\/talks","tracks_uri":"http:\/\/api.joind.in\/v2.1\/events\/3950\/tracks","attending_uri":"http:\/\/api.joind.in\/v2.1\/events\/3950\/attending","website_uri":"http:\/\/joind.in\/event\/view\/3950","all_talk_comments_uri":"http:\/\/api.joind.in\/v2.1\/events\/3950\/talk_comments","hosts":[{"host_name":"AFUP","host_uri":"http:\/\/api.joind.in\/v2.1\/users\/22401"}],"attendees_uri":"http:\/\/api.joind.in\/v2.1\/events\/3950\/attendees","can_edit":false},{"name":"linux.conf.au 2016 Geelong - LCA By the Bay","url_friendly_name":"linuxconfau-2016-geelong---lca-by-the-bay","start_date":"2016-02-01T00:00:00+11:00","end_date":"2016-02-05T23:59:59+11:00","description":"http:\/\/linux.conf.au is one of the largest linux and open source conferences in the Asia-Pacific region.
